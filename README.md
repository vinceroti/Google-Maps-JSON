# Google-Ski-Plotter

## Description
Google ski plotter is an Express/Vue web app that takes your google location data and determines if you're skiing or snowboarding based on
location data and activity data provided by Google. This is android specific because android correctly tracks your data.

_NOTE: This will only determine if you're skiing inbounds at a resort. Skewed data might exist such as mountain biking at resorts due to google thinking both actitvties are the same based on speed and vertical descent_
